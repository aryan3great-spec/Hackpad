i have taken inspiration and guidance from the guide provided by hack club;I intend to use it to setup macros for while I am writing notes to swtich colours and whatnot; or for multimedia control ; or too play minecraft lol , thinking of speedrunning the game 
For simple functioning of the macropad i have decided on 4 buttons to execute tasks as mentioned above. 

PS: I apologise for the ugly formatting havent gotten down to learn how to use github quite yet 

This will be the design of my hackpad;
